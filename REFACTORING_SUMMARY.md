- **Prevention of duplicate API calls** during auth loading

### Benefits:

- No more API calls with invalid/missing auth tokens
- Consistent behavior across all protected routes
- Better error handling and user experience

- ‚ùå Repetitive code and inconsistent patterns
- ‚ùå Dead code and unused imports

### After Refactoring:

- ‚úÖ Centralized constants and configuration
- ‚úÖ Optimized loading states with global context
- ‚úÖ Single, comprehensive AuthGuard component
- ‚úÖ Dynamic, configurable routing system
- ‚úÖ Safe API calls that wait for auth readiness
- ‚úÖ Reusable utilities following DRY principles
- ‚úÖ Clean codebase with no dead code

2. **Advanced Authentication System**
3. **Scalable Navigation Architecture**
4. **Comprehensive Error Handling**
5. **Reusable Utility Library**
6. **Performance Optimizations**
7. **Clean Code Architecture**

## Next Steps for Further Enhancement
